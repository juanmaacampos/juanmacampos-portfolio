## About the Project

This portfolio serves as a digital resume to highlight my technical skills, projects, and contact information. It was built from scratch using modern web technologies and reflects my interest in clean code, user-friendly design, and automation.

The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [https://juanmaacampos.github.io/juanmacampos-portfolio](https://juanmaacampos.github.io/juanmacampos-portfolio) (update with your actual GitHub Pages URL once deployed).
